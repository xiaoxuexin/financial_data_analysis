# financial_data_analysis

This is based on STATS 509: Financial Data Analysis. 

The code was completed by R, but in the form of R Markdown.

We mainly used Time Series models, such ARIMA and GARCH, to handle the financial data that happened to a series of data points in the past and attempted to predict what will happen to it the future.
